            <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but
                great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

        <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
            accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain
            uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company
            work, a society work, a civilisation work.
